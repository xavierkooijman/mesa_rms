# MESA

MESA is a restaurant management system designed to organise various restaurant operations in one place. Having grown up loving food and working in restaurants, I always found that the systems used were outdated and poorly designed, making them visually hard to understand and clunky to use. There were physical tickets, poor data analysis, manual inventory management and constant phone rigging for reservations. Staff had to write down their clock-ins and clock-outs and work schedules were complicated. Services were spread out across different companies: one for point of sale, another for reservations, another for staff management, and so on. MESA solves these problems by supplying a fully customisable, easy-to-set-up, centralised restaurant management system available on the web. There is no need to install software or have a technician install the service, simply use your computer and access everything related to managing your restaurant with a simple, easy-to-understand and easy-to-use webapp. You can manage orders, reservations, staff, work schedules, clock-ins and clock-outs, inventory, recipes, tables and takeaways in one centralised service.
